If you're fetching data from server and html file with javascript code server from different server
you will need to add HTTP headers to support cross origin
("Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header on server side)

See more details here [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
